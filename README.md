# CorsikaParser

This repository hosts the code for parsing CORSIKA output files to later be used in my multivariate analysis.

The parsing is based on the original parsing used in the raw CORSIKA output files generated for the surface array of IceCube-Gen2, the next generation upgrade to the IceCube Neutrino Observatory.
